# Advanced Image Editor

A desktop image editing application built with Python and DearPyGUI that combines traditional photo editing tools with modern AI capabilities. The editor provides standard adjustment controls (exposure, color grading, curves) alongside advanced features like automatic object segmentation using Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) and AI-powered content replacement through Stable Diffusion inpainting models. The application supports mask-based selective editing, allowing users to apply different adjustments to specific regions of an image or generate new content within selected areas using text prompts.

## Features

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Optional: CUDA-compatible GPU for AI features
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended for AI features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd image-editor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install dearpygui opencv-python numpy pillow
   
   # For AI features (optional but recommended)
   pip install torch torchvision diffusers transformers
   pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
   ```

3. **Download AI Models** (Optional)
   
   For AI features, place these models in `assets/models/`:
   - **SAM Model**: `sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth` - Download from [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)
   - **Inpainting Model**: `512-inpainting-ema.ckpt` - Stable Diffusion inpainting checkpoint

### Running

```bash
python main_production.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Operations

1. **Load Image**: Use File menu or dialog to open supported formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF)
2. **Edit**: Use exposure and color panels to adjust image parameters
3. **Transform**: Enable crop mode to rotate, flip, or crop the image  
4. **Export**: Save the edited image in desired format

### AI Features

1. **Segmentation**: Open Masks panel and click "Auto Segment" to detect objects
2. **Selective Editing**: Select masks and apply different adjustments to regions
3. **Inpainting**: Select a mask, enter text prompts, and click "Reimagine" to replace content

### Performance Notes

- AI features use GPU when available, fall back to CPU
- Large images are automatically resized for processing
- Segmentation runs in background to maintain UI responsiveness

### Key Design Patterns

- **Service Layer**: Separates business logic from UI
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable UI components
- **Event-Driven**: Reactive updates with callback system
- **Memory Management**: Automatic GPU/CPU optimization
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing dependencies

## Configuration

### Performance Settings

The application automatically configures optimal settings based on your hardware:

- **GPU Detection**: Automatically uses CUDA when available
- **Memory Limits**: Adaptive based on available RAM
- **Processing Threads**: Optimized for your CPU cores
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent cleanup and optimization

### Customization

- Update throttling intervals
- Memory usage thresholds
- Rendering quality settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"CUDA out of memory"**
- Reduce image size or disable GPU acceleration
- Close other GPU-intensive applications
- Use CPU fallback mode

**"Model not found"**
- Ensure AI models are in `assets/models/` directory
- Check file permissions and paths
- Download models from official sources

**"Slow performance"**
- Enable GPU acceleration if available
- Reduce number of visible mask overlays
- Close unnecessary applications

### Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
