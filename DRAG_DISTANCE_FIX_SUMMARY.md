# Bounding Box Drag Distance Fix - Summary

## Problem Fixed

The bounding box resizing functionality had a critical issue where dragging corner handles large distances (e.g., 200px) would cause the rectangle to **move** instead of **resize** properly. Users could click on handles but the terminal showed "no handle hit", and when dragging worked, large movements caused unexpected behavior.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the **coordinate system conversion** between:
1. **Texture/Image coordinates** (Y increases downward, origin at top-left)
2. **Plot coordinates** (Y increases upward, origin at bottom-left)

### Specific Issues Found:

1. **Handle Hit Detection Mismatch**: 
   - `hit_test_handles()` received coordinates in texture coordinate system
   - `get_handle_positions()` returned coordinates in plot coordinate system  
   - No conversion between systems caused handles to appear at wrong positions

2. **Y-Axis Inversion**: 
   - Image coordinates: (0,0) = top-left, Y increases downward
   - Plot coordinates: (0,0) = bottom-left, Y increases upward
   - Missing Y-axis conversion: `plot_y = texture_height - texture_y`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Handle Hit Detection (`hit_test_handles`)

**Before:**
```python
def hit_test_handles(self, x: float, y: float) -> Optional[HandleType]:
    handle_positions = self.get_handle_positions()  # Returns plot coords
    for handle_type, (hx, hy) in handle_positions.items():
        distance = abs(x - hx) + abs(y - hy)  # Comparing texture coords to plot coords!
        if distance <= self.handle_threshold:
            return handle_type
    return None
```

**After:**
```python
def hit_test_handles(self, x: float, y: float) -> Optional[HandleType]:
    """Test if coordinates hit any handle.
    
    Args:
        x, y: Coordinates in texture/image coordinate system (Y increases downward)
    """
    # Convert input coordinates from texture coords to plot coords for comparison
    plot_x = x
    plot_y = self.texture_height - y  # Convert Y from texture coords to plot coords
    
    handle_positions = self.get_handle_positions()  # Returns plot coords
    for handle_type, (hx, hy) in handle_positions.items():
        distance = abs(plot_x - hx) + abs(plot_y - hy)  # Now comparing plot coords to plot coords
        if distance <= self.handle_threshold:
            return handle_type
    return None
```

### 2. Coordinate System Documentation

Added clear documentation throughout the code specifying which coordinate system is used:

- **Texture/Image coordinates**: Used for internal calculations, mouse input
- **Plot coordinates**: Used for handle positioning, display

### 3. Consistent Y-Axis Conversion

Ensured all coordinate conversions properly handle Y-axis inversion:
```python
# Image to Plot: plot_y = texture_height - image_y  
# Plot to Image: image_y = texture_height - plot_y
```

## Testing Verification

Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix:

1. **test_final_drag_fix.py**: Simulates dragging 200px and verifies correct behavior
2. **test_coordinate_consistency.py**: Tests coordinate system conversions
3. **test_real_drag_issue.py**: Reproduces the original problem scenario

### Test Results:
- ✅ Handle detection now works correctly
- ✅ Large drag distances (200px+) resize properly without moving the box
- ✅ Top-left corner stays fixed when dragging bottom-right corner
- ✅ Dimensions increase correctly by drag distance
- ✅ All coordinate systems work consistently

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- Users couldn't reliably click on bounding box handles
- Large drag movements caused unexpected box movement
- Resize functionality was unreliable
- Terminal showed "no handle hit" errors

### After Fix:
- ✅ Reliable handle detection for all corners and edges
- ✅ Smooth resizing with large drag distances  
- ✅ Proper anchor point behavior (opposite corner stays fixed)
- ✅ Consistent coordinate system throughout the application

## Files Modified

1. **`ui/bounding_box_renderer.py`**:
   - Fixed `hit_test_handles()` coordinate conversion
   - Improved `screen_to_texture_coords()` 
   - Added coordinate system documentation
   - Removed debug print statements

## Verification

The fix was verified with multiple test scenarios:
- Small drags (20px) - ✅ Works correctly
- Medium drags (50px) - ✅ Works correctly  
- Large drags (200px) - ✅ **Now works correctly** (was broken before)
- Various handle types - ✅ All work correctly
- Coordinate edge cases - ✅ All handle properly

The large drag distance issue that caused rectangles to move instead of resize has been **completely resolved**.
