# Crop Mode Drag Delay Fix

## Problem Description
When resizing or moving the bounding box in crop mode, there was a delay after releasing the mouse button. During this delay period, if the cursor was moved, the bounding box would continue to be modified unexpectedly.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by several interacting factors:

1. **Throttling Mechanism**: The `update_rectangle_overlay()` method had a throttling mechanism with `update_interval = 1/60` (16.67ms) to prevent excessive updates during drag operations.

2. **Callback Timing**: When the mouse was released, the `on_mouse_release` handler would call both the `on_change_callback` and `on_end_drag_callback`, potentially triggering updates after the drag state was supposedly cleared.

3. **State Management**: The `drag_active` flag in `CropRotateUI` and `is_dragging` flag in `BoundingBoxRenderer` could get out of sync, allowing updates to continue after release.

4. **Residual Events**: Mouse movement events or other callbacks could still trigger bounding box modifications during the throttling delay period after release.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Callback Sequence in BoundingBoxRenderer
```python
def on_mouse_release(self, sender, app_data) -> bool:
    # ... clear drag state ...
    if was_dragging:
        # Only call end_drag_callback, not on_change_callback
        # This prevents modifications after drag_active is set to False
        if self.on_end_drag_callback:
            self.on_end_drag_callback(self.bounding_box.copy())
```

### 2. Added Drag State Guards in CropRotateUI
```python
def _on_bbox_change(self, bbox: BoundingBox) -> None:
    # Only process changes if we're actually dragging
    if not self.drag_active:
        return
    # ... rest of the method
```

### 3. Enhanced Update Mechanism
```python
def update_rectangle_overlay(self, force_update=False):
    # Allow bypassing throttling when drag ends
    if not force_update and current_time - self.last_update_time < self.update_interval:
        return
    # ... rest of the method

def _on_bbox_end_drag(self, bbox: BoundingBox) -> None:
    self.drag_active = False
    self.user_rect = bbox.to_dict()
    # Force immediate update when drag ends (bypass throttling)
    self.update_rectangle_overlay(force_update=True)
```

### 4. Added Mouse Button State Verification
```python
def on_mouse_drag(self, sender, app_data) -> bool:
    # Additional safety check: ensure left mouse button is still pressed
    if not dpg.is_mouse_button_down(dpg.mvMouseButton_Left):
        # Force end the drag if mouse button is not pressed
        self.is_dragging = False
        self.drag_mode = DragMode.NONE
        self.drag_handle = None
        self.drag_start_box = None
        return False
```

### 5. Enhanced Mouse Event Filtering
```python
def on_mouse_drag(self, sender, app_data):
    # Only process drag if crop mode is active and we're actually dragging
    if crop_mode and self.bbox_renderer.bounding_box and self.drag_active:
        return self.bbox_renderer.on_mouse_drag(sender, app_data)
    return False

def on_mouse_release(self, sender, app_data):
    # Additional safety: ensure drag_active is cleared
    if self.drag_active and not self.bbox_renderer.is_dragging:
        self.drag_active = False
```

## Testing Results

After implementing the fix:
- ✅ No more delay-related bounding box modifications
- ✅ Clean drag state management
- ✅ Immediate visual updates when drag ends
- ✅ Proper event filtering prevents unwanted modifications
- ✅ Robust state synchronization between components

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- Bounding box would continue to be modified after mouse release
- Cursor movement during delay period caused unwanted changes
- Inconsistent drag state between components
- Poor user experience with unpredictable behavior

### After Fix:
- ✅ Clean drag operation termination
- ✅ No modifications after mouse release
- ✅ Immediate visual feedback
- ✅ Predictable and responsive user interface
- ✅ Robust state management across all components

The fix ensures that crop mode drag operations behave exactly as users expect, with no delays or unexpected modifications after releasing the mouse button.
