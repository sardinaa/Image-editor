# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Method Error
- **Problem**: `'MaskOverlayRenderer' object has no attribute '_apply_transformations'`
- **Solution**: Added the missing `_apply_transformations` method to handle mask transformations
- **Impact**: Eliminates runtime errors when working with mask overlays

### 2. Mask Overlay Visibility
- **Problem**: Mask overlays not showing when clicking on masks
- **Solution**: 
  - Ensured `update_mask_overlays` is called before showing overlays
  - Added status messages for better user feedback
  - Fixed the overlay creation pipeline
- **Impact**: Masks now display correctly when selected

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Adaptive Performance Configuration (`utils/performance_config.py`)
- **Dynamic Settings**: Performance mode detection (performance/default/high_performance)
- **Configurable Limits**: Adjustable max masks, batch sizes, UI throttling
- **Quality Filtering**: Filter masks by area, stability, and IoU scores
- **Environment Variables**: Support for `IMAGE_EDITOR_PERFORMANCE_MODE`

### 2. Intelligent Mask Caching (`utils/mask_cache.py`)
- **LRU Cache**: Least Recently Used caching for mask data and overlays
- **Smart Cleanup**: Automatic cache cleanup based on usage patterns
- **Performance Manager**: Manages visible masks and quality filtering
- **Memory Efficient**: Limits cache size and removes old entries

### 3. Enhanced Masks Panel Performance
- **Reduced Thread Pool**: Changed from 2 to 1 worker thread for better resource management
- **Quality-Based Filtering**: Automatically filters low-quality masks
- **Incremental UI Updates**: Batched mask processing to prevent UI freezing
- **Throttled Updates**: Prevents overwhelming the UI with rapid updates

### 4. Optimized Mask Overlay Renderer
- **Progressive Loading**: Creates overlays in small batches
- **Visibility Limits**: Maximum of 50 simultaneously visible overlays by default
- **Update Throttling**: 50ms minimum between overlay updates
- **Smart Caching**: Caches overlay data to avoid recreation

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations
- **High Memory Usage**: No caching, all masks loaded simultaneously
- **UI Freezing**: Large mask sets caused UI to become unresponsive
- **Poor Quality Control**: No filtering of low-quality masks
- **Resource Intensive**: Multiple threads, no throttling

### After Optimizations
- **Reduced Memory**: Intelligent caching and cleanup
- **Smooth UI**: Incremental loading prevents freezing
- **Better Quality**: Automatic filtering of poor masks
- **Efficient Resources**: Single thread pool, throttled updates

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set performance mode
export IMAGE_EDITOR_PERFORMANCE_MODE=performance  # Ultra-lightweight
export IMAGE_EDITOR_PERFORMANCE_MODE=default      # Balanced (default)
export IMAGE_EDITOR_PERFORMANCE_MODE=high_performance  # More masks, faster
```

### Performance Modes
1. **Performance Mode** (Ultra-lightweight)
   - Max 15 masks
   - Higher quality thresholds
   - More aggressive throttling
   - Fewer visible overlays (50)

2. **Default Mode** (Balanced)
   - Max 25 masks
   - Balanced quality thresholds
   - Standard throttling
   - Moderate visible overlays (50)

3. **High Performance Mode** (More features)
   - Max 50 masks
   - Lower quality thresholds
   - Less throttling
   - More visible overlays (50)

### Manual Configuration
```python
# In masks panel
masks_panel.set_segmentation_limits(max_masks=30, batch_size=5)

# Performance manager settings
from utils.performance_config import PerformanceConfig
config = PerformanceConfig.get_optimized_settings('performance')
```

## Usage Recommendations

### For Slower Systems
- Use `performance` mode: `export IMAGE_EDITOR_PERFORMANCE_MODE=performance`
- Lower max masks limit in UI (15 or fewer)
- Enable quality filtering

### For Faster Systems
- Use `high_performance` mode: `export IMAGE_EDITOR_PERFORMANCE_MODE=high_performance`
- Increase max masks limit (up to 50)
- Adjust batch sizes for smoother loading

### General Best Practices
1. **Load Images Progressively**: Use auto-segmentation in small batches
2. **Monitor Memory**: Check system resources with many masks
3. **Quality First**: Enable quality filtering to reduce noise
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Clear masks periodically to free memory

## Technical Details

### Key Classes
- `PerformanceConfig`: Configuration management
- `MaskCache`: Intelligent caching system
- `PerformanceMaskManager`: Mask management with optimizations
- `MaskOverlayRenderer`: Optimized overlay rendering

### Memory Management
- Cache size limits (100 masks max)
- Automatic cleanup every 30 seconds
- LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
- Overlay-specific cache with smaller limits

### UI Optimizations
- 150ms UI update throttling (increased from 100ms)
- Batch size reduced to 5 (from 10)
- Progressive overlay updates
- Limited simultaneous visible overlays

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Adaptive Batch Sizing**: Adjust batch size based on system performance
2. **Background Processing**: Non-blocking segmentation operations
3. **Smart Preloading**: Predictive mask loading based on user patterns
4. **Compression**: Compressed mask storage for memory efficiency

### Experimental Features
1. **Machine Learning**: ML-based quality assessment
2. **Multi-threading**: Parallel overlay rendering
3. **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA-based mask processing
4. **Virtual Scrolling**: For very large mask lists

The optimizations provide significant performance improvements, especially when working with many masks, while maintaining the full functionality of the image editor.
